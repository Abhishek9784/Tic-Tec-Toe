# Features

  • Classic 3×3 Tic-Tac-Toe gameplay

  • Two-player mode: Players alternate placing X and O

  • Win detection for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines

  • Draw (no-win) detection when the grid is full

  • Instant win announcement

  • Game reset to start a new match

# Technologies Used

  • HTML — for structuring the gameplay grid and UI

  • CSS — to style the grid, buttons, and overall layout

  • JavaScript — to manage game logic, player turns, win/draw detection, and UI updates

# Installation & Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   
   git clone https://github.com/Abhishek9784/Tic-Tec-Toe.git
   cd Tic-Tec-Toe

2. Open index.html in your preferred web browser—or simply visit the live demo.

3. Play the game, and click the “Reset” (or similar) button to restart anytime.

# How It Works

  a) The HTML defines a 3×3 grid with clickable elements.

  b) JavaScript tracks who's turn it is, checks for winning combinations or a full grid.

  c) When a player wins or the game ends in a draw, a message is displayed.

  d) Players can restart to play again.
